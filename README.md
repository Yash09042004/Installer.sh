The installer.sh script is a bash script that automates the process of installing essential software on a Linux system. It likely contains a series of commands that use the system's package manager (like apt, yum, dnf, etc.) to install various software packages.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to run this script:

Download the script: You can download the script from the GitHub repository. If you have git installed, you can clone the entire repository with the command:
git clone https://github.com/Yash09042004/Installer.sh.git

Navigate to the directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory containing the installer.sh script:
cd Installer.sh

Make the script executable: Before you can run the script, you need to make it executable. You can do this with the chmod command:
chmod +x installer.sh

Run the script: Now you can run the script. Since it's a bash script, you use the bash command to run it:
bash installer.sh

This will start the script, which will likely present you with a menu of software to install. Follow the prompts to install your desired software.

Remember to run the script with superuser privileges (using sudo) if the script installs software system-wide.
