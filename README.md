# Installer.sh

The `installer.sh` script is a bash script that automates the process of installing essential software on a Linux system. It uses the system's package manager (like apt, yum, dnf, etc.) to install various software packages.

## Prerequisites

- Git must be installed on your system to clone the repository.
- You must have superuser (sudo) privileges to install software system-wide.

## Installation and Usage

Follow these steps to download, make executable, and run the `installer.sh` script.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Download the script from the GitHub repository. If you have git installed, you can clone the entire repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yash09042004/Installer.sh.git

```
2. Navigate to the Directory
Use the cd command to navigate to the directory containing the installer.sh script:
cd Installer.sh

3. Make the Script Executable
Before you can run the script, you need to make it executable. You can do this with the chmod command:
chmod +x installer.sh

4. Run the Script
Now you can run the script. Since it's a bash script, use the bash command to run it:
bash installer.sh

Note
Remember to run the script with superuser privileges (using sudo) if the script installs software system-wide. For example:
sudo bash installer.sh

Thank you for using installer.sh! Happy installing!
